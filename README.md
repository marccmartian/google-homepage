- Grab the URL for an image from an existing webpage
- Center an element horizontally
- Identify three ways you can include your CSS styles in a page

### Drawbacks
I had problems installing linux (xubuntu distribution), my computer has Windows, and it was not successful to convert to a dual system (in two attempts).

Choose to virtualize linux with VMWare, after an error updating the operating system, everything ran perfectly.
